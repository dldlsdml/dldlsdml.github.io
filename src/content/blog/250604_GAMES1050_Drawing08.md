#### Comment   
The 2D concept seems ta bit life-less, which can make sense for a wooden doll, but has less appeal. The side and front seem to be aligned ok, but the front is tilted to the side and the neck isn't in the middle. I appreciate the extra notes for texture and detail! 
The 3D model is structured well for the most part, there is some strange geometry around the arms. Using a large brush with broad strokes could help the crisscross nature of the texture. It might also be less obvious if there were a few more details throughout the character.
