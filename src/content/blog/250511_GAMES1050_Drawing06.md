#### Feedback   
Visual Recognition(95/100): Pretty simple in design but it is clean and it looks like it belongs in a cartoon style game.   
Shown effort to make the weapon a single modelled object(50/50): Followed directions!   
Shown effort to optimize geometry/remove n-gons(40/50): There's one n-gon at the top of the hilt, but for the most part you've done a good job of avoiding them. There are a few bunched areas that should be fixed.
